[Mozilla Web Compatibility Team](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Mobile#People) is having a **[weekly meeting](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Compatibility/Mobile#Minutes_and_Progress_Reports)**. We developed a few tools to edit and prepare the minutes for inserting them directly in the wikipedia wiki markup. 

So far, we do

* List of new created bugs
* List of closed bugs (except duplicate)
* List of blog posts on [webcompat Planet](http://planet.webcompat.com/)

For now the Makefile is the best way to create the different parts. It could change in the future.

## Changes History

* 2013-12-16: Adding a feature for the list of blog posts on [webcompat Planet](http://planet.webcompat.com/)
